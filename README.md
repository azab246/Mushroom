## Disclaimer

This App Is Made By A __Complete Noob__ With Only 2 Months Of Experience On CS and Hasn't Worked on any Similar Projects Before,

 __And Even Though The App is Working btw__, The Code Might be just A Complete Peice Of Trash In Some Perspectives,
 
Some Might See It as an Inefficient Masterpiece and _bc of my lackage of experience_ It Might Even Have Securety Flaws,

I Can Clearly Agree About That The Code Needs An Intense Cleaning _Even In My POV_, And I Can't Guarantee That I'll Even Maintain It  
<br>
So Even Though The App Is __Working Effectively__,
You Are Using It At __Your Own Responsability__ :>

<br><br>
## Still Under Development
