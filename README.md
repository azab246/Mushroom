## Disclaimer

This App Is Made By A __Complete Noob__ With Only 2 Months Of Experience On CS and Hasn't Worked on any Similar Projects Before, While This Project Is Made Mainly As a [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) Final Project     
<br>
 __So Even Though The App is Working__, The Code Might be just A Complete Peice Of Trash In Some Perspectives,
Some Might See It as an Inefficiency Masterpiece and _bc of my lack of experience_ It Might Even Have __Security Flaws__,   
<br>
btw I Can Clearly Agree About That The Code Needs An __Intense Cleaning__ _Even In My POV_, And I Can't Guarantee That I'll Even Maintain It  
<br>
So While I Can Say That The App Is __Working Effectively__,
You Are Still Using It At __Your Own Responsability__ :>

<br><br>

## Still Under Development
