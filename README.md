## Disclaimer

This app is made by a __complete noob__ with only 2 months of experience on cs and hasn't worked on any similar projects before, while this project is made mainly as a [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) final project     
<br>
 __So even though the app is completely working__, the code might be just a complete peice of trash in some perspectives,
some might see it as an inefficiency masterpiece and _bc of my lack of experience_ it might even have __security flaws__, you might face __sudden crashes__, High memory usage __~150 mb__ after/during the download of quite large number __(+10)__ of tasks at the same time, __bad memory management__    
<br>
btw i can clearly agree about that the code needs an __intense cleaning__ _even in my pov_, and __i can't guarantee that i'll even maintain it__  
<br>
So while i can say that the app is __working effectively__,
You are still using It at __your own responsability__ :>
