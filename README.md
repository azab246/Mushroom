## Notes
A FFMPEG static build will be downloaded at the first app launch.

The app uses [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) to handle youtube DASH streams (the method used for all downloads).

## Usage
1. Install flatpak via [these instructions](https://flatpak.org/setup/)
2. Download the release, then locate the `.flatpak` file and run `sudo flatpak install com.github.azab246.mushroom.flatpak` within the same directory
3. Run `flatpak run com.github.azab246.mushroom`

## Build from source

Using __GNOME Builder__ will automatically resolve all relevant flatpak SDKs automatically. You can then export the bundle if you wish.

Alternatively, you can build it with __Meson__:

 clone the repo and use the following commands to build .

    meson builddir --prefix=/usr/local
    sudo ninja -C builddir install

### To build a flatpak from the command line:


    flatpak-builder --user --install 
    flatpak-builddir com.github.azab246.mushroom.json
    flatpak run com.github.azab246.mushroom
